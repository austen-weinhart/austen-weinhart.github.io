            When Oliver was two years old, he was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome shortly after his older brother was diagnosed with Autism. Throughout Oliver's adolescent years, he struggled with his speech, making friends, and lacked self confidence in his intelligence
            and ability to succeed. Through the motivational forces of autism influencers such as Temple Grandin, Oliver transformed his mentality of what it truly meant to be a person on the autism spectrum. With this newly adopted mentality, Oliver
            drove himself to success in his college years at California Lutheran University (CLU), where he obtained his Real Estate Salesperson License, co-founded CLU's professional business fraternity Delta Sigma Pi, and won CLU's 2016 New Venture
            Competition. Since Oliver's graduation, Oliver has devoted himself to his real estate representation at Compass in Beverly Hills as well as building up Coding Autism.

            Austen Weinhart comes from a background of extensive experience in the technology space, performing roles in marketing, quality assurance, and web development. Early on as a student at UC Berkeley, Austen acted as president of the public relations student
            group, PR @ Cal. After graduating from Berkeley, he worked on both technical and marketing projects for high-profile clients such as Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and others. Austen was drawn into Coding Autism both for his passion for
            autism advocacy and also as someone who is a product of a coding bootcamp education. Austen is eager to create an environment where others can turn their lives around by learning to code, just as he did.

            I have been working in the field of Education, Diversity, &amp; Inclusion for over 16 years with over 10 years in Tech, with the last 6 years at Google. My passion is developing and designing leadership, EQ based programs, &amp; diversity programs that
            stick with long lasting impact. Learning needs to be hands on and continuous. I have scaled programs for companies globally to over 20 offices. I specialize in building strong internal coaching and mentoring programs that last long after our
            programs have been delivered. It's with a strong diverse community that organizations continue to thrive, grow, remain creative and innovative. I am a consultant, facilitator, advocate, coach, and mentor. I identify as neurodiverse and am
            active in the disability community. While still in college at University of California, Berkeley I created a full inclusion social skills camp that became well known throughout the Bay Area that provided services for over 6o families. Currently,
            I continue to mentor youth and young adults with and without disabilities to pursue their dreams and careers in technology, science and math. I am also an avid diver, foodie, traveler (28 countries to date) and enjoy a good glass of wine.
