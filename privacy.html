                    Cookies are small text files that include a unique reference code placed on a visitors' device to store their preferences and sometimes track information.

Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to our Site or Service and will last for longer.  Some cookies are necessary to enable you to move around the Site and use the Service such as accessing the secure areas of the Site, and they enable us to provide you with the Services you have requested.  “Performance cookies” collect aggregated, anonymous, statistical information on how visitors use our Site and Service.  We use this information to make improvements to the Site and our Service and to enhance your overall experience.  Other cookies, called “functionality cookies,” allow the Site and Service to remember choices you make such as your user name when you login to your account or the language or region you are in.

                  We and our third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies to gather information about the pages visited through our advertising partners, both on our Site as well as other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment."  This information is then used by us and our third-party vendors to serve interest-based advertisements when you visit our Site and other websites.  For more information about this type of interest based advertising, and about how to opt-out of the automated collection of information by third-party ad networks, please visit the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.

                  We also use Google Analytics Advertising Features including Google Analytics Remarketing to advertise across websites, Demographics and Interest Reporting and AdWords and AdSense integrations to collect data about our Site traffic via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers.  We do not facilitate the merging of Personal Information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected through any Google advertising product.
