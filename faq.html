                              Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during early childhood and affect a person’s ability to communicate and interact with others.

                                  In the United States today, there are over 4 million individuals with autism: roughly 3 million being children and 1 million being adults.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  Since 2002, autism prevalence has increased by 6-15% year over year and was deemed as one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the United States.

                                  Out of all the adults on the autism spectrum, over 80% of them are either unemployed or underemployed
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                  1 out of every 68 children born in the United States are born with a form of autism

                                  Autism is about 5x more prevalent in boys than it is in girls.

                                <li>
                                  Ever since 1994 when autism was redefined as wide spectrum ranging from low-functioning and non-verbal variation to the high-functioning Asperger’s Syndrome, the autism prevalence rate has been increasing 6-15% each year in the United States. Despite the increases in autism prevalence and the millions of autistic children and adults living in the US, there has been a lack of effective resources that have helped adults with autism in the transition from high school into the real world. In fact, 66% of all autistic americans either do not continue their education or obtain a job within 2 years after their high school graduation. This, amongst other factors, is one of the primary reasons as to why over 80% of all autistic adults are either unemployed or underemployed.

                                  Throughout the last 15 years, there has been a significant amount of research from highly credible sources that has stated that autism has a positive correlation with career positions within the technology industry. In fact, some researchers has defined autism as the “Geek Syndrome”, as many of the technology hubs within the United States derive of individuals with autism. Autistic characteristics such as attention to detail, their fascination for repetition, and introversion are all prime examples what what is required to be a successful employee within the technology industry. In combination with the $50k+ average annual salary for entry-level full-time technology employees such as web developers and quality assurance representatives, the technology industry has started to become an attractive industry for adults with autism to pursue careers in.

                              Your investment will go towards the development of Coding Autism’s first ASPIRE program, which is an Autism specialized program that provides services to adults with autism such as Social skill building, Portfolio building, Integrated training in web development and quality assurance and Real-world preparation and coaching with the end goal of gaining opportunistic Employment within the technology industry.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Each offering within the Coding Autism ASPIRE program is elaborated in further detail below.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              A = Autism Specificity
                              Every aspect of Coding Autism is designed to best fit the needs of learners on the Autism Spectrum. From small class sizes, on-site occupational therapists, and special emphasis on interpersonal communication and collaboration, we are able to best set our students up for success.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              S = Social Skill Building
                              Often times the biggest barrier for Autistic employment is not knowledge or skill proficiency, but the lack of intrinsic social skills, such as making eye contact or reading social cues.  To best ensure that our students can succeed in the workplace we place a special emphasis on social skill building. This also encourages students to build new friendships among their peers and build a network that will stick with them long after they graduate.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              P = Portfolio Building
                              Students come out of Coding Autism with a portfolio of full-stack web applications, which will be what they show to employers to demonstrate their proficiency. We give our students the freedom to build applications around whatever subjects they are most passionate about. Allowing them to experience the magic of seeing their passions come to life.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              I =  Integrated Curriculum
                              Coding Autism’s web development immersive is a full-stack program teaching our students foundational front-end and back-end web development. We also incorporate QA (quality assurance) and SCRUM principles, so that our students can be exposed to the greater ecosystem around software development.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              R = Real-World Preparation and Coaching
                              We set our students up with the tools they need to succeed in a world that is not necessarily built for them. The real world can be daunting for an individual with autism so we work with our students to ensure that they are prepared for the real-world in all fronts from personal financial management to arriving to work prepared and on-time.
                              <br>

                              E = Employment
                              By the end of the program, our students are setup to attain an entry level web developer position, with the tools they need to not only stay financially self-sufficient, but grow into a long term career where they can flourish.  We help our students find the roles best suited to them through on-site career counseling, corporate partnerships, career fairs and more.  We also help them build their resumes and practice for interviews.                            </div>

                              Pricing and packages will be announced as we get closer to launch, but the tuition will cost within the range that similar coding bootcamps charge. This can range from $10,000 - $20,000.  We will offer options for financing and tuition subsidization to make this price point more palatable.  While this may seem high, we need to be able to retain highly skilled employees in order to provide a quality education. And entry level developer jobs start at $50,000 per year, so while this is a large investment in the short term, it will pay off in the long term.

                              Upon completion of the course, students will receive a certificate of completion. As with other coding bootcamps, we are not accredited. What students show their employers is the quality of their portfolio, the work that they produce while at Coding Autism.  We are not an academic institution, but a company focused around training students with real-world vocational skills.

                              Students will apply by filling out an application on our website. We will review the applications and reach out to students that we think would be a good fit. From there we will conduct interviews, either in person or through video conferencing.

                              With our web development immersive, we will be vetting students based on our assessment that they can keep up with the rigorous coursework and be employable with the proper training. Autism is a spectrum, and some students will have an easier time acclimating to neurotypical workspaces than others. This does not mean that we have forgotten nonverbal or other students with greater barriers. As we expand we will be providing other programs that will allow these types of learners an opportunity to acquire new skills, socialize, and demonstrate their talents. For the program we are fundraising for now, we are limiting our scope to the students that we think we can best equip to find employment after graduation.                            </div>

                              Our first classes will be operating out of Thousand Oaks, in the Greater Los Angeles area. These will be in-person classes. While we do believe that in-person classes will offer the most benefit to our students, we do recognize the demand for online classes, so it is a matter of time before we offer something that satisfies that need.  As we grow, we will expand our locations to other key tech cities.  For now though, LA is our home base where we have access to the thriving Silicon Beach tech community.
