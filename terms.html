                    The
                    <strong>“Coding Autism Service”</strong>
                    means the website located at www.generalassemb.ly and any associated software, applications, and Internet services under Coding Autism’s control, whether partial or otherwise, used in connection with providing the services provided by Coding Autism.  The Coding Autism Service provides an online platform to enable you to view information online and through other connected devices about classes, courses, workshops, and other education programs and events offered by Coding Autism (collectively, <strong>“Courses”</strong>).  These Courses are at the intersection of technology, design, and entrepreneurship and may be made available for free or for a fee, in Coding Autism’s sole discretion.  Together with our members, thought leaders, and seasoned practitioners (collectively <strong>“Instructors”</strong>), Coding Autism offers a robust curriculum focused on entrepreneurship and practices by which design and technology can be leveraged to create industry-changing products and successful companies. The Coding Autism Service will also permit the community of users of the Coding Autism Service to engage in discussions and communications with one another and with the Instructors.  <strong>“Premium Content”</strong> means Coding Autism’s multi-media content library of all prior and current Courses and live-stream transmissions of future Courses.

These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge.  Please contact your card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.

If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Coding Autism Service infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Coding Autism a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.  The notice must include the following information:

                    <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);</li>
                    <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
                    <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>

                  <p>
                    If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Coding Autism a counter-notice.

                    <br>
                    Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.
